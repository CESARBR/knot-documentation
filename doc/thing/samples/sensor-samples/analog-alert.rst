analog-alert
============

Overview
--------

The analog-alert example reads an analog sensor, converts the read value
to float and depending on a threshold value, lights an LED. The purpose of
this sample is to show how to use an analog sensor using the KNoT Zephyr SDK.

Requirements
------------

The demo assumes that an analog output is connected to the 0.31 pin.
Make sure to use VDD OUT as the positive reference and GND as the negative
reference.
