plate
=====

Overview
--------

The plate example simulates a device registering the read car plate in a
sensor. It updates the current plate by changing the numbers for a new
random generated sequence. The purpose of this sample is to show how to
register a string value as a sensor using the KNoT Zephyr SDK.
